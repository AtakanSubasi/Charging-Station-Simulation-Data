# Electric Vehicle Charging Station Analysis and Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across multiple regions, including Istanbul, Turkey. It aims to explore the spatial distribution of stations and provide insights into potential improvements for enhanced accessibility and utilization.

### Disclaimer

The dataset used in this project is simulation-based and was randomly generated to mimic real-world scenarios. The geographic coordinates, charging demands, and other metrics are entirely synthetic and do not represent actual data. The stations are distributed across various regions, not limited to Istanbul. This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following fields:

- **Station ID**: A unique identifier for each charging station.
- **Latitude & Longitude**: Geographic coordinates of the station.
- **Estimated Demand**: Simulated data representing the charging demand at each station.
- **Other Attributes**: Additional simulated metrics related to station usage.

### Access the Dataset

The dataset is available in the repository and can be downloaded directly from the following link: [Download Charging Station Simulation Data]

## Key Features

- **Geographic Visualization**: Visualize the simulated distribution of charging stations using mapping libraries.
- **Demand Analysis**: Understand the simulated charging demand across different locations.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Identify potential areas for station placement improvement based on simulated insights.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   
bash
   git clone [https://github.com/username/repository-name.git](https://github.com/AtakanSubasi/Charging-Station-Simulation-Data.git)


2. **Install Dependencies** Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using pip:

   
bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** Open the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository to execute the analysis and visualization steps:
